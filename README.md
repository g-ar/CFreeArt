# CFreeArt
Context Free Art codes
- Generating art using context free grammar

## Install and run
- Install the software in debian based systems:
  `sudo apt-get install contextfree`
- Generate image:
  `cfdg <input>.cfdg -o <output>.png`
- All codes are for version 2.2, since that's the version provided by debian wheezy, and version 3 requires g++ v4.8 to compile. Converting to v3 code is not so difficult.
